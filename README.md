# protein_folding-decoy-set
The decoy sets we used include the multiple decoy sets from the Decoys ‘R’ Us collection (http://compbio.buffalo.edu/dd/download.shtml), which include the 4state_reduced, fisa, fisa_casp3, hg_structal, ig_structal, ig_structal_hires, lattice_ssfit, lmds, and lmds_v2 decoy sets. The MOULDER decoy set1 was downloaded from https://salilab.org/decoys/; the I-TASSER decoy set-II was obtained from https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/decoys/decoy2.html; and the ROSETTA all-atom decoy set from https://zenodo.org/record/48780#.WvtCA63MzLF. 
All protein structures (including both native and decoys) were converted into their biological oligomerization state and prepared with the Protein Preparation Wizard,44 which adds missing atoms, optimizes the H-bond network, and performs energy minimization to clean up the structures for subsequent calculations.
