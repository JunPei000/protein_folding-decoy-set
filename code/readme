path needs to be changed in order to run codes correctly.

(1) in code 'nonb_calc.py', a path of nonbond data base should be added to line 14.

(2) in code 'torsion_calc_para.py', the path of torsion and range data base should be added to line 16 and 17.

(3) in code 'protein_info_finder.py', the path of file 'parm94-2.mol2' should be added to line 11.
 
(4) in code 'ref_des_build.py', the path of torsion and nonbond data base should be added to line 14 and 21, respectively.

(5) in code 'descriptor_finder_with_orig_KECSA2.py', the path of decoy set with one native and several decoys should be added to line 18.

(6) in code 'final_descriptor_builder.py', the path of the file contains 'descriptort'(the descriptor for torsion part) and the path of the file contains 'descriptorn' (the descriptor for nonbond part) should be added to line 23 and 24, respectively. the path of the output file should be added to line 55.

(7) in code 'RF_grid_search.py', the path of directory which contains all the csv files generated by code 'final_descriptor_builder.py' should be added to line 17.

After setting up those required pathes, run:
(1) python descriptor_finder_with_orig_KECSA2.py
(2) python final_descriptor_builder.py
(3) python RF_grid_search.py
